# Core™ MVP Strategy - Small Trades Focus
**Status: Living Document - Subject to Change/Updates/New Ideas**  
**Last Updated: August 2025**  
**Focus: Build Ivy AS THE Product**

---

## The Pivot: From "Business OS" to "Ivy IS Your Business"

### Core Insight
**We're not building a chatbot that helps run a business.**  
**We're building Ivy to BE the business.**

When a customer texts, calls, or visits the website - they're not talking to a representative. They're talking directly to the business itself. Ivy isn't the interface to your operations - Ivy IS your operations.

### Brand Strategy for MVP
- **Customer-facing brand**: "Ivy" (friendly, memorable, human)
- **Platform name**: Core™ (for later expansion, contracts, technical docs)
- **Pitch**: "Ivy books jobs, sends quotes, takes deposits while you're on the tools"
- **NOT**: "Core for Trades integrated AI platform" (too technical for tradies)

---

## Target Market: Small Australian Trades

### Who We're Building For
- **New/early-stage tradies** (0-2 years in business)
- **Solo operators** (landscapers, bricklayers, cleaners, mobile mechanics)
- **Current "system"**: Facebook page + mobile phone
- **Pain**: Missing jobs while on tools, quoting takes forever, chasing payments
- **Dream**: Jobs in calendar, money in bank, no tech headaches

### Why This Market First
1. **No legacy systems** - Nothing to migrate or integrate
2. **Desperate for solution** - Currently losing money from missed leads
3. **Simple needs** - Book jobs, send quotes, get paid
4. **Price sensitive but value-aware** - Will pay for what works
5. **Word-of-mouth goldmine** - Tradies talk to tradies

---

## The MVP Product: "Ivy for Trades"

### The Pitch
**"Ivy books jobs and takes deposits while you're on the tools."**

Not another app to learn. Not another subscription to manage. Just Ivy - your 24/7 business assistant that never misses a lead, never forgets a quote, and never lets an invoice slip.

### What They Get

**Customer Experience:**
1. **Professional website** - Not a Facebook page, a real business presence
2. **Ivy answers everything** - Available 24/7 via chat, SMS, or voice
3. **Quick quotes** - Generated in minutes, not days
4. **Book directly** - See availability, pick a time, done
5. **Pay deposits** - Secure the job immediately

**Tradie Experience:**
1. **One login** - Everything in one place
2. **Jobs dashboard** - See what's coming up
3. **Quote templates** - Consistent pricing, instant delivery
4. **Payment tracking** - Know who's paid, who hasn't
5. **Customer database** - Never lose a contact

## Technical Architecture (Using What We've Built)

### Frontend (What Customers See)
```
Next.js site (clone from CoreSentia)
├── Homepage (services, areas, gallery)
├── Ivy Chat (the star of the show)
│   ├── Interactive service cards
│   ├── Inline calendar booking
│   ├── Live quote generation
│   └── Payment processing
└── Customer portal (view quotes, receipts)
```

### Ivy's Evolution: From Bot to Business Brain
```javascript
// Current Ivy: Qualifies and routes
if (userNeedsQuote) {
  sendToHuman();
}

// MVP Ivy: Completes the entire transaction
if (userNeedsQuote) {
  showServiceOptions();    // Interactive cards
  calculatePrice();         // Based on inputs
  generateQuote();         // PDF with e-sign
  processDeposit();        // Stripe checkout
  bookJob();               // Calendar integration
  sendConfirmation();      // Email/SMS
}
```

### Backend (Simple but Complete)
- **Database**: Supabase (customers, jobs, quotes, payments)
- **Auth**: Supabase Auth (one login for tradie)
- **Payments**: Stripe (no card data on our servers)
- **Calendar**: Google Calendar API (simple, works)
- **Email**: SendGrid (transactional only)
- **SMS**: Twilio (confirmations, reminders)

### What We DON'T Need for MVP
- ❌ Multi-user access
- ❌ Complex permissions
- ❌ Inventory management
- ❌ Subcontractor management
- ❌ Accounting integration (just CSV export)
- ❌ Custom reporting

  pricing: { mowing: { base: 80, perSqm: 0.50 }},
  serviceAreas: ["Flagstone", "Jimboomba", "Park Ridge"],

  colors: { primary: "#2A7F3E", ... }
}
```

## Go-to-Market: Flagstone First

### Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Next 30 Days)
1. **Build MVP using CoreSentia base**
2. **Deploy demo**: ivy.coresentia.com/trades-demo
3. **Create "Mike's Landscaping" fake demo** (fully functional)
4. **Record 2-minute video** showing lead → quote → payment
5. **Post in Flagstone Community Facebook groups**

### The Facebook Post
```
"Sick of missing jobs while you're on the tools? 

I built Ivy - she answers your phone, books jobs, 
sends quotes, and takes deposits. All automatic, 24/7.

Watch her in action: [demo video]

First 2 local trades get it FREE for 3 months 
(normally $200/month). I just need your feedback.

Not another subscription - you'll own this.
Comment below or message me."
```

### Phase 2: First 2 Pilots (Days 30-60)
- **Target**: 1 landscaper, 1 cleaner/pressure washer
- **Pilot Deal**: 
  - FREE setup (normally $3,000)
  - FREE 3 months hosting (normally $200/month)
  - In exchange: Weekly feedback calls, testimonial, referrals
- **Support**: White glove for first 2 weeks, then standard
- **Success metrics**: 
  - Time to first booking (target: same day)
  - Quote acceptance rate (target: 50%+)
  - Deposit collection rate (target: 80%+)

### Phase 3: Refine & Scale (Days 60-90)
- **Incorporate pilot feedback**
- **Optimize deployment process**
- **Create self-service onboarding video**
- **Launch at market price**: $3,000 setup + $200/month
- **Referral program**: $500 credit for each referral

---

## Pricing Model

### Pilot Pricing (First 2 Clients)
- **Setup**: FREE (normally $3,000)
- **First 3 months**: FREE (normally $200/month)
- **After 3 months**: $200/month ongoing
- **Commitment**: Feedback + testimonial + 3 referrals

### Market Pricing (Clients 3-10)
- **Setup**: $3,000 (one-time)
- **Hosting**: $200/month
- **What they own**: The code, the data, the system
- **What we provide**: Hosting, updates, support (2 hrs/month included)

### Why This Works
- **Compare to**: ServiceM8 at $79/month = $948/year forever
- **Our model**: Own it after year 2, just pay hosting
- **Psychology**: Tradies understand owning vs renting (tools, vehicles)

---

## Success Metrics (Realistic)

### Technical Success
- [ ] Lead to booking: < 5 minutes (not 60 seconds)
- [ ] Quote generation: < 2 minutes (not 30 seconds)
- [ ] Payment processing: < 5 minutes (not 2 minutes)
- [ ] 95% automated (some human intervention OK)
- [ ] 99% uptime (occasional maintenance windows OK)

### Business Success
- [ ] 50% reduction in missed leads
- [ ] Same-day quote delivery (vs 2-3 days)
- [ ] 80% deposit collection rate

- [ ] ROI positive in 90 days

### Marketing Claims

- "Quotes while they wait"
- "Never miss another lead"
- "Get deposits instantly"

---

## Support Structure

### Pilot Phase (First 2 Clients)
- **Week 1-2**: Daily check-ins, immediate fixes
- **Week 3-4**: Every 2 days, gathering feedback
- **Month 2-3**: Weekly calls, optimization

### Standard Support (Post-Pilot)
- **Included**: 2 hours/month support
- **Response time**: Next business day
- **Channels**: Email, scheduled calls
- **Additional support**: $100/hour

### Support Boundaries
- Configuration changes: Included
- New features: Quoted separately
- "Can Ivy do X?": "That's on the roadmap for v2"

---

## The Moat We're Building

### Why This Becomes Defensible
1. **Ivy gets smarter** - Every interaction improves responses
2. **Industry templates** - Build once, deploy many
3. **Network effects** - Tradies refer tradies
4. **Brand ownership** - "Ivy" becomes the name they trust
5. **Technical complexity** - Competitors need months to replicate

### The Evolution Path
```
MVP: Ivy for Trades → 
v2: Ivy for Service Businesses → 
v3: Ivy for Professionals → 
v4: Full Core™ Platform Vision
```

But always: **Ivy is the face, Core™ is the platform**

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Payment compliance**: Use Stripe's hosted checkout (PCI burden on them)
- **Data privacy**: Clear privacy policy, data stays in Australia
- **Uptime**: Vercel + Supabase = enterprise reliability
- **Over-promising**: Market "minutes not days" vs "instant everything"

### Business Risks
- **Support burden**: Clear 2hr/month boundary after pilot
- **Feature creep**: "That's in v2" - stay focused
- **Price resistance**: Lead with ownership, show missed job recovery
- **Pilot dropout**: Get commitment upfront for 3 months

---

## The Vision (What This Becomes)

**Year 1**: 50 trades using Ivy  
**Year 2**: 500 trades, Ivy for Services launches  
**Year 3**: "Ivy" becomes how new businesses start  
**Year 5**: Core™ platform powers thousands of Ivys

But it all starts with Mike's Landscaping in Flagstone.

---

## Remember

**For tradies: "Ivy runs your business while you're on the tools"**  
**For us: "We're building the Core™ platform that powers every Ivy"**

When someone asks a tradie "How do you manage everything?"  
The answer: **"Ivy handles it all."**
