## Design Philosophy
**"High Dynamic Range AI Aesthetic"**  
Deep blacks contrasted with bright accents. The design suggests intelligence and awareness while maintaining professional credibility. Cutting-edge aesthetic that conveys trust through sophisticated visual language. Never use emojis.

## Core Visual Identity

### Color Palette
- **Primary Cyan:** #62D4F9 (98, 212, 249)
- **Secondary Blue:** #2A50DF (42, 80, 223)  
- **Tertiary Aqua:** #40FFD9 (64, 255, 217)
- **Pure Black:** #000000

***Never use fade or high opacity - full colours only, including black and whte - for all assets: buttons, text, containers etc***

### Typography
- **Headers:** Montserrat (400, 500, 600 weight) with 0.15em letter spacing
- **Body Text:** Open Sans, system-ui fallback
- **Size Hierarchy:** Headers at 20px/16px/10px, Body at 16px, Small at 14px

### Key Design Elements
1. **Glassmorphism effects** throughout (backdrop-blur, semi-transparent backgrounds)
3. **High contrast** between deep blacks and bright cyans/whites
4. **Subtle animations** for state changes (300ms transitions standard)

## Updates Made (August 3, 2025)

### 1. Background Animation System
- **Implemented dual-canvas particle network**
  - Background canvas: Gradient overlay with mouse interaction
  - Particle canvas: Bright white "stars" with variable glow intensity
  - Blue particles (#62D4F9) forming connection networks
- **Enhanced particle effects:**
  - 30% bright white particles with random glow intensity (0.4-1.0)
  - Subtle pulsing animation on white particles
  - Increased contrast between particles and background
- **Background image:** Set to 30% opacity for darker overall appearance

### 2. Navigation Icons
- **Replaced emoji with Lucide React icons:**
  - âš¡ â†’ `<Zap />` with cyan glow
  - ðŸ§  â†’ `<Brain />` with cyan glow  
  - ðŸ”“ â†’ `<Unlock />` with cyan glow


### 3. Header Enhancement
- **Sticky header with scroll effects:**
  - Transparent initially
  - On scroll: 70% black background with backdrop blur
  - Logo gains glow effect when scrolled
  - Animated cyan border appears at bottom
- **Refined navigation:**
  - Smaller text (text-sm) with wider tracking
  - Underline hover effects on nav links
  - "Chat with Ivy" button with enhanced glow on hover
- **Seamless transition** from hero to scrolled state

### 4. Technical Improvements
- Fixed "Background" text issue (was in the JPG file itself)
- Added proper favicon handling
- Separated Header into client component for scroll state management
- Optimized particle rendering with dual canvas approach

## Design Principles Moving Forward

### Button Hierarchy
1. **Primary Button:** Cyan background and border with black text + glow on hover
2. **Secondary Button:** Secondary Brand Blue (#40FFD9) with white text, #40FFD9 border + on hover = change to Primary Cyan brand colour and subtle glow.
3. **Navigation:** Subtle underline animations


### Component Standards
- **Cards:** Black/50 background, white/10 border, hover to cyan/30 border
- **Buttons:** Rounded-full, scale-105 on hover, transition-all
- **Text:** White primary, white/60 secondary, cyan for emphasis
- **Sections:** Border-t border-white/10 for separation

### Animation Guidelines
- **Standard transition:** 300ms ease-in-out
- **Hover states:** Transform scale(1.05) for buttons
- **Glow effects:** Subtle: 0 0 8px

## Next Development Areas

### Immediate Priorities
3. Add loading states with particle effects
4. Create page transition animations

### Future Enhancements
1. Voice visualization with cyan waveforms
2. Advanced scroll-triggered animations
3. Interactive particle effects on CTA hover
4. Dynamic theme variations (time-based color temperature)

## Reference Implementation
The homepage (page.tsx) serves as the canonical reference for all design decisions. New pages and components should maintain this aesthetic vocabulary while adapting to their specific needs.

**Core Rule:** Every design decision reinforces the message: "Stop talking about AI. Start closing with it."
