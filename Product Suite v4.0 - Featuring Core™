## The Name: Why Core‚Ñ¢

### The Philosophy Behind "Core"

We didn't choose this name lightly. After considering dozens of alternatives - from technical acronyms to Silicon Valley neologisms - we landed on something profoundly simple: **Core**.

**Why?** Because that's exactly what it becomes.

When implemented, businesses naturally start referring to it as "the Core":
- "Is that in the Core yet?"
- "Check the Core for that lead"
- "The Core handled everything"

It's not *a* core system - it becomes **THE Core** of their operations. The simplicity is the power. Like how "the CRM" means Salesforce or "the Drive" means Google Drive, "the Core" will mean the central nervous system where businesses actually run.

**Legally protected as:** CoreSentia Core‚Ñ¢  
**Marketed as:** Core‚Ñ¢ by CoreSentia  
**Used as:** "The Core"

This evolution happens naturally. We don't force it - we just build something so fundamental that there's no other way to describe it.

## Why Core‚Ñ¢ Wins

### 1. We're Not Selling Software
We're selling the elimination of operational overhead. One system replaces 5 job functions and 12 software subscriptions.

- **Break-even:** 6 weeks

Nobody else is doing true unified business operations. While competitors link to calendars, we embed them. While they mention products, we display them. While they promise quotes, we generate them live.

### 5. Australian Built, Globally Capable
Brisbane-based team understanding local business needs, building for global scale.

**Run it from the Core, or run around in circles.**
