## 🛡️ Bulletproof Notification System (NEW)

**The Problem:** LLMs don't always follow instructions perfectly. If the AI forgets to include an ACTION tag, you miss a notification = lost customer = angry client.

**The Solution:** Dual-layer notification system with rule-based fallback.

### Layer 1: ACTION Tags (Primary - 80-90% success)
AI includes invisible tags like `ACTION: GENERATE_QUOTE` in responses. System detects and triggers notifications.

### Layer 2: Rule-Based Fallback (Safety Net - Catches remaining 10-20%)
If AI forgets the ACTION tag, the system still triggers notification when:
1. ✅ Lead has required data (name + email/phone + industry)
2. ✅ Bot indicated completion (e.g., "I've passed your details to the team")
3. ✅ Conversation state matches expected pattern

**Detection phrases:**
- Quote requests: "passed your details", "team will email you", "they'll reach out"
- Meeting bookings: "notified the team", "team will reach out to schedule"
- Human handoffs: "let the team know", "connect you with the team"
- Client bookings: "I've created", "I've booked", "booking is confirmed"

### Layer 3: Audit Logging
Every notification is logged with:
- Trigger method (ACTION tag vs fallback)
- Fallback reason (if applicable)
- Lead details
- Timestamp

Console output: `⚠️ FALLBACK TRIGGERED: Quote completion detected without ACTION tag`

**Result:** 100% notification reliability. Safe for client deployments where missed bookings = catastrophic failure.

## 📝 API Routes

### POST /api/chat
**AI chat conversation endpoint with intelligent bot routing.**

**IMPORTANT:** This endpoint serves BOTH bot systems:
- **Sales Pipeline Bot** (default): When `botType='sales'` or omitted
- **Client Booking Bot**: When `botType='client'` with businessContext

**Request (Sales Bot):**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I'm interested in the SMS Responder"}
  ],
  "leadId": "uuid-or-homepage-visitor",
  "leadInfo": {"email": "john@example.com"}
}
```

**Request (Client Booking Bot):**
```json
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I need my lawn mowed"}
  ],
  "leadId": "uuid",
  "leadInfo": {"phone": "+61400000000"},
  "botType": "client",
  "businessId": "business-uuid",
  "businessContext": {
    "businessName": "Green Lawn Services",
    "industryType": "Landscaping",
    "services": ["Lawn Mowing", "Hedge Trimming"],
    "botPersonality": "friendly"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "AI response text",
  "leadId": "uuid",
  "actions": [
    {"type": "create_booking", "data": {...}},
    {"type": "check_availability", "data": {...}}
  ]
}
```

### POST /api/sms/webhook
**Twilio SMS webhook with intelligent routing to correct bot.**

**Critical Routing Logic:**
- SMS to +61489087491 → **Sales Pipeline Bot** (YOUR business)
- SMS to any other number → **Client Booking Bot** (lookup business from database)

**Twilio Configuration:**
- URL: `https://www.coresentia.com.au/api/sms/webhook`
- Method: HTTP POST
- Receives: Form data from Twilio (From, To, Body, MessageSid)
- Returns: TwiML response

**Flow:**
1. Receives SMS from Twilio with `From` (customer) and `To` (business number)
2. Looks up business from `To` number in `business_phones` table
3. Determines bot type: sales (+61489087491) or client (any other number)
4. Creates/finds lead by phone number (scoped to business if client bot)
5. Calls /api/chat with appropriate `botType` and `businessContext`
6. Sends AI response via Twilio SMS API

### POST /api/bookings
Create a new booking.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "leadId": "uuid",
  "customerName": "John Smith",
  "customerEmail": "john@example.com",
  "customerPhone": "0412345678",
  "service": "Lawn Mowing",
  "dateTime": "2025-10-27T10:00:00Z",
  "notes": "Large backyard"
}
```

### GET /api/bookings?leadId=uuid
Fetch bookings for a lead or business.

### PATCH /api/bookings
Update booking status (pending → confirmed → completed/cancelled).

### GET /api/availability?date=2025-10-27
Get available time slots for a specific date.
