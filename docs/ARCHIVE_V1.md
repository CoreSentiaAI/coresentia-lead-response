# Archive: CoreSentia v1.0 "Ivy" Build

**Period:** July 2025 - October 2025
**Status:** Archived (preserved in branch `archive/v1-ivy-custom-packages`)
**Why Archived:** Strategic pivot to simplified two-tier model

---

## üì¶ What v1.0 Was

The original CoreSentia build was a **comprehensive AI lead management platform** with complex features:

### Features Built
- **Ivy AI Assistant** - Personality-driven chat with "AI Reality Check‚Ñ¢" branding
- **Three-tier pricing:**
  - Essentials: $3,000 + $300/mo
  - Custom: $10,000 + $500/mo
  - Website + AI Bundle: $15,000 + $500/mo
- **Xero Integration** - OAuth flow, automatic quote/invoice creation
- **PDF Quote Generation** - Via DocRaptor API
- **Complex Lead Scoring** - AI-powered qualification system
- **Reality Check Card** - Persistent UI element for strategy sessions
- **Command Center** - Quick action buttons in chat
- **Multi-channel support** - Web, SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram (planned)

### Design Aesthetic
- **"High Dynamic Range AI"** theme
- **Colors:** Cyan (#62D4F9), Blue (#2A50DF), Aqua (#40FFD9), Black
- **Vibe:** Sci-fi, tech-forward, glowing effects
- **Personality:** Ivy as a named AI assistant

### Target Market (v1.0)
- Generic "Australian businesses"
- Professional services
- SMEs
- Healthcare, Real Estate, Trades, B2B

---

## üéØ Why We Pivoted

### The Problem
1. **Too complex for MVP:** Xero integration, PDF generation, multi-tier pricing before validation
2. **No clear differentiation:** Web chatbots are commodity; everyone offers them
3. **Unclear target:** "All businesses" = no businesses
4. **High setup cost:** $3k+ barrier to entry for testing
5. **Long delivery:** 2 weeks minimum, complex setups
6. **Sci-fi branding:** Not trustworthy for small local businesses

### The Insight
After reflection and market research:
- **Tradies have a specific pain:** Miss calls while on tools, lose leads to competitors
- **SMS is differentiated:** No one else does AI SMS booking for local services
- **Price matters:** $1,200 is impulse-buy, $3k+ requires approval
- **Speed matters:** 2-3 day delivery = competitive advantage
- **Professional beats sci-fi:** Navy/orange is more trustworthy than cyan/black

- ‚úÖ Supabase database setup
- ‚úÖ Claude AI integration
- ‚úÖ Lead tracking system
- ‚úÖ Conversation history
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting logic

- Target: Solo tradies (Flagstone pilot)
- Roadmap: 50 by EOY, 500 by year 2
- **Status:** Deferred to 2027+ (need to prove v2.0 first)

### 2. Product Suite v4.0 - Featuring Core‚Ñ¢
- Three-tier structure with Core‚Ñ¢ at top

## üí° Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Next.js architecture** - Solid foundation, kept it
2. **Claude AI integration** - Works great, kept it
3. **Supabase database** - Simple and effective
4. **Two-month build sprint** - Built a lot quickly with AI help
5. **Strategic documents** - Forced clarity (even if we pivoted)

### What Didn't Work
1. **Building before validating** - Should have talked to customers first
2. **Feature creep** - Xero, quotes, multi-channel = too much too soon
3. **Generic positioning** - "All businesses" = no one
4. **Complex pricing** - Three tiers confusing before anyone knows you
5. **Named AI personality** - "Ivy" felt gimmicky for B2B

### What We'd Do Differently
1. **Start with interviews** - Talk to 10 tradies before writing code
2. **Build one thing well** - SMS booking only, then iterate
3. **Price lower initially** - $1k barrier is easier to cross than $3k
4. **Ship incomplete** - MVP doesn't need Xero integration
5. **Test messaging** - "Never miss a lead" > "AI Reality Check"
