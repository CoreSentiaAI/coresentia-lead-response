## ‚ùì FAQs

### Q: Can I customize the form fields?
**A:** Yes! Edit `/app/onboarding/page.tsx` and add/remove fields as needed. Make sure to also update the API endpoint and database schema.

### Q: Can I integrate this with the admin dashboard?
**A:** Yes, this is planned! For now, you can view submissions in Supabase. Future update will show them in `/admin`.

### Q: What if client doesn't have all the info?
**A:** The form only requires essential fields (marked with *). Everything else is optional. They can fill out what they know and you can clarify the rest on the setup call.

### Q: Can I send them a unique link per client?
**A:** The current form is public (anyone can access). Future enhancement could create unique links like `/onboarding/[clientId]` for tracking.

### Q: Should I charge full payment upfront?
**A:** 50/50 split is recommended for trust and protection. See payment workflow section above for pros/cons of each approach.

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Form submission failed"
- **Check:** Is the `client_onboarding` table created in Supabase?
- **Check:** Are environment variables configured correctly?
- **Check:** Open browser console (F12) to see error messages

### "Table does not exist"
- **Fix:** Run the SQL from `DATABASE_SCHEMA_ONBOARDING.sql` in Supabase

### "Permission denied"
- **Fix:** Check RLS policies in Supabase - the service role should have full access
