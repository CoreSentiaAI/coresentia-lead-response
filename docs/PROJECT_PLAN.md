## üèóÔ∏è Two-Phase Development Approach

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DISTINCTION:**

### Phase 1: CoreSentia Marketing System (CURRENT)
**Purpose:** Build our own lead generation and sales infrastructure
**Timeline:** October 2025 - December 2025
**Goal:** Capture and qualify leads who want to BUY CoreSentia services

**What We're Building:**
- Website at coresentia.com.au selling our products
- Web chat that pitches SMS Responder & Professional Package
- SMS number (+61489087491) that demonstrates the product
- **Lead Actions:** Calendar bookings + Quote generation
- Lead notification system for CoreSentia team
- Dashboard to manage OUR incoming leads

**Why This Comes First:**
- We need a working demo potential clients can interact with
- "Text our number to see how it works" is powerful sales
- Validates the product before building complex multi-tenant system
- Generates revenue while building Phase 2

### Phase 2: Client SMS Product Template (NEXT)
**Purpose:** The actual product we deploy to paying customers
**Timeline:** January 2026 - March 2026
**Goal:** Scalable system to onboard and manage multiple client businesses

**What We'll Build:**
- Multi-business database architecture
- Business profile management (hours, services, branding)
- Per-client AI customization system
- Website template builder (Professional Package)
- **Client Actions:** Appointment bookings only (no quotes)
- Client onboarding workflow
- White-label dashboard for clients

**Why This Comes Second:**
- Requires proven product-market fit first
- More complex architecture (multi-tenant)
- Needs real customer feedback to build correctly
- Can iterate based on pilot customer learnings

## üéì Lessons Learned

### Strategic Pivot (October 2025)

**Original Vision (v1.0 "Ivy"):**
- Three-tier pricing (Essentials $3k, Custom $10k, Website+AI $15k)
- Complex lead scoring and qualification
- Xero integration, PDF quotes, multi-channel
- Generic "AI business partner" positioning
- Cyan/black sci-fi aesthetic

**New Vision (v2.0):**
- Two-tier pricing (SMS $1.2k, Professional $2.5k)
- Focused on appointment booking
- SMS-first (differentiated!)
- Specific: "AI receptionist for local services"
- Professional navy/orange branding

**Why we pivoted:**
1. **Target market clarity:** Tradies don't need complex CRM, they need to not miss calls
2. **Differentiation:** SMS bot is unique, web chat is commoditized
3. **Delivery speed:** Simpler = faster setup = more customers
4. **Price point:** $1,200 is impulse-buy territory for small business
5. **Proof of concept:** Need to validate with real customers before building Core‚Ñ¢

### Key Insights

1. **Start simple:** SMS + booking is enough to prove value
2. **Speed matters:** 2-3 day delivery is a massive competitive advantage
3. **Focus:** "Local service businesses" is specific enough to resonate
4. **Pricing:** Under $1,500 setup = easy yes, avoid budget approval hell
5. **No name needed:** "AI assistant" is more professional than "Ivy"

---

## üîÆ Future Vision (2027+)

Once we have 50-100 customers and proven the model:
