## 🔀 Two Separate Systems

CoreSentia has **TWO DISTINCT workflows** that are often confused. This README clarifies the difference.

---

## 1️⃣ CoreSentia Sales Pipeline (YOUR Business)

**File:** `CORESENTIA_SALES_PIPELINE.md`

**What it is:** How YOU acquire clients for CoreSentia

**Players:**
- **Leads:** Businesses interested in buying CoreSentia
- **You:** CoreSentia owner selling the service
- **Your Admin Dashboard:** coresentia.com.au/admin

**Flow:**
1. Lead finds CoreSentia website
2. AI bot qualifies them
3. You follow up with quote/call
4. They sign up and pay
5. You onboard them

**Key Point:** This is about getting paying clients onto your platform.

## 2️⃣ Client Booking System (YOUR CLIENTS' Business)

**File:** `CLIENT_BOOKING_WORKFLOW.md`

**What it is:** The PRODUCT your clients use after they're onboarded

**Players:**
- **End Customers:** People booking with your clients (homeowners, salon clients, etc.)
- **Your Clients:** Business owners using CoreSentia (tradies, salons, etc.)
- **AI Receptionist:** Bot handling bookings for your client
- **Client Dashboard:** Where your clients manage their bookings

**Flow:**
1. End customer contacts your client (SMS/web)
2. AI qualifies and suggests booking times
3. Customer agrees → pending booking created
4. Your client gets SMS notification
5. Client confirms → both parties get confirmation SMS

**Key Point:** This is the actual service your clients pay for.

## 🎯 Which One Are You Working On?

**Ask yourself:**
- "Am I trying to get more CoreSentia clients?" → Use `CORESENTIA_SALES_PIPELINE.md`
- "Am I building/fixing the booking system clients use?" → Use `CLIENT_BOOKING_WORKFLOW.md`

## 📁 Other Important Files

- `SERVICE_AGREEMENT_TEMPLATE.md` - Contract for new clients signing up
- `CLIENT_ONBOARDING_FORM` - Technical form completed after client pays (business hours, services, etc.)

## 🚀 Current Focus

**As of November 2025:** Primary development is on the **Client Booking System** (calendar, dashboard, booking management). This is the core product.

Sales pipeline is stable and working. Focus is making the product bulletproof.

**Remember:** Don't confuse the two! Your clients' success depends on a smooth booking system. Your success depends on a smooth sales pipeline.
