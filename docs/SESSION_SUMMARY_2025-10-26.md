## 🎯 What We Accomplished Today

### 1. **Complete v2.0 Rebrand & Pivot** ✅
- Archived v1.0 "Ivy" build (3-tier complex system)

  - **Professional Package:** $2,500 + $250/mo (inc. GST)
- New color scheme: Navy (#1E3A5F) + Orange (#FF6B35)
- Removed "Ivy" AI personality → Generic "AI assistant"
- Updated all pricing to include GST (Australian business)

### 2. **Built Availability System** ✅
- `/api/availability` endpoint - checks free time slots
- Business hours configuration (Mon-Fri 9am-5pm default)
- Generates hourly slots based on booking duration
- Filters out already-booked times
- Returns available slots for AI to suggest

### 3. **Double-Booking Prevention** ✅
- Updated `/api/bookings` POST endpoint
- Checks for conflicts within ±1 hour window
- Returns 409 Conflict error if slot taken
- Validates datetime format (ISO 8601)
- Provides details about conflicting bookings

### 4. **Mobile-First Booking Dashboard** ✅
- Built at `/dashboard/[businessId]`
- Features:
  - View all bookings (filter: Upcoming/Past/All)
  - Quick stats (upcoming count, total, confirmed)
  - One-tap confirm/cancel buttons
  - Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
  - Click-to-call phone, click-to-email
  - Status badges (pending/confirmed/completed/cancelled)
  - Mobile-optimized design

### 5. **Homepage "How It Works" Section** ✅
- 3-step visual workflow with mockups
- Real-world example: "8pm, watching the footy..."
- Shows SMS conversation flow
- Dashboard UI preview
- Stats: 24/7, <10s response, 2sec confirm
- **Tradie-friendly language** without revealing tech secrets

### 6. **Cleaned Up Codebase** ✅
- Removed v1.0 legacy code:
  - Xero integration
  - PDF quote generation
  - RealityCheckCard component
  - NetworkCanvas background
- Preserved in `archive/v1-ivy-custom-packages` branch
- Updated InlineChatForm to new color scheme

### 7. **Database Cleanup** ✅
- Removed v1.0 tables: `follow_ups`, `qualifications`, `quotes`
- Kept essential tables: `leads`, `conversations`, `bookings`, `settings`
- Added `business_settings` table for multi-business (future)
- Created default business hours configuration

### 8. **Deployed to Production** ✅
- All code pushed to GitHub
- Vercel auto-deployed
- Production site live at https://www.coresentia.com.au/

---

## 📋 Current State

### ✅ **What's Working:**
- Homepage (rebrand complete, "How It Works" section)
- Chat interface (navy/orange design)
- Availability API (`/api/availability`)
- Bookings API (`/api/bookings`) with conflict detection
- Dashboard (`/dashboard/[businessId]`)
- All deployed to production

### ⏳ **Waiting On:**
- **Twilio regulatory approval** (submitted today, 24-48 hours)
- Need phone number to build SMS webhook

### 🚧 **Not Built Yet:**
- SMS webhook (`/api/sms/webhook`)
- SMS → AI → Booking flow
- SMS notifications to contractor/customer
- End-to-end SMS testing

---

## 🎯 The Product (Elevator Pitch)

**CoreSentia = AI Receptionist for Local Service Businesses**

**How it works:**
1. Lead texts business number → "Can you mow my lawn?"
2. AI responds instantly, books appointment automatically
3. Contractor taps "Confirm" on mobile dashboard (2 seconds)
4. Done. No phone tag, no missed calls.

**Target market:** Solo tradies, mobile services, salons
**Key differentiator:** SMS-first (everyone else does web chat)
**Price:** Under $1,500 setup = impulse buy for small business

## 🚀 Next Steps (When Twilio Approves)

### **Immediate Tasks:**
1. Build SMS webhook endpoint (`/app/api/sms/webhook/route.ts`)
2. Connect Twilio to webhook URL
3. Link SMS conversations to existing chat logic
4. Test SMS → AI → Booking flow

### **SMS Webhook Logic:**
```
Incoming SMS → Twilio
↓
POST to /api/sms/webhook
↓
Extract: phone, message, from number
↓
Look up or create lead in database
↓
Send to AI chat endpoint
↓
AI responds → Send via Twilio SMS API
```

### **Notification System (Future):**
- SMS to contractor when booking created
- SMS to customer when booking confirmed
- Email notifications (optional)
- Calendar sync (Google Calendar)

---

## 💡 Key Insights from Today

### **What Works:**
1. **Simplicity is genius** - The SMS → Confirm workflow is elegant
2. **Tradie language matters** - "Watching the footy" > "free time"
3. **Show, don't tell** - Mockups > descriptions
4. **Under $1,500 = impulse buy** - No budget approval needed
5. **No auth for MVP** - Unique URLs are simpler than login

### **Strategic Decisions:**
- Built our own booking system (not Calendly)
  - Cheaper for customers
  - More control
  - Mobile-first
- No AI "personality" or name
  - More professional
  - Less gimmicky
- SMS-first differentiation
  - Web chat is commoditized
  - SMS for tradies is unique

## 🧪 Testing the System

### **Test the Dashboard:**
```
https://www.coresentia.com.au/dashboard/a0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
```
Should show 2 test bookings (John Smith, Sarah Johnson)

### **Test Availability API:**
```bash
curl "https://www.coresentia.com.au/api/availability?date=2025-10-28"
```
Returns 8 available slots (9am-5pm, hourly)

### **Create Test Booking (needs real UUIDs):**
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
INSERT INTO bookings (lead_id, business_id, customer_name, customer_email,
  customer_phone, service, date_time, notes, status)
VALUES (
  'a0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
  'a0000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
  'Test Customer',
  'test@example.com',
  '0412 345 678',
  'Lawn Mowing',
  '2025-10-29T10:00:00Z',
  'Test booking notes',
  'pending'
);
```
