## 🚀 What We Accomplished Today

### 1. **SMS Integration - LIVE** ✅
- Integrated Twilio SMS API
- Business number: +61489087491
- Webhook receiving incoming SMS
- AI responding automatically within seconds
- Full conversation history tracked
- SMS source tracking in database

**Flow:**
1. Lead texts +61489087491
2. Twilio → Webhook → AI processing
3. AI responds via SMS immediately
4. Conversation stored in database
5. Admin gets notification

### 2. **Lead Notification System** ✅
- SMS notifications to admin phone
- Triggers on:
  - Human handoff requests 🚨
  - Quote requests 💰
  - High-value leads ⭐

- Notifications don't block chat responses (async)

**Example notification:**
```
🚨 HUMAN REQUEST
Lead: John Smith
Phone: 0412345678
Source: sms

They want to speak with you! Check dashboard for conversation.
```

### 3. **Human Handoff System** ✅
- Natural language detection ("Can I speak to someone?")
- Smart logic: Don't ask for info we already have
- SMS = already have phone, no need to ask
- Email mentioned earlier = use it, don't repeat
- Clean user experience, no friction

### 4. **Action Tag Cleanup** ✅
- ACTION tags now completely invisible to users
- Added `stripActionTags()` function
- Removes standalone tags, inline tags, cleans whitespace
- Backend codes never leak to customer-facing messages
- Professional, polished UX

### 5. **Legacy Code Removal** ✅
Removed ALL v1.0 "Ivy" references:

- ❌ "CUSTOM product" and "take over hosting"
- ❌ "15-minute consultation" language
- ✅ Updated to current products: SMS Responder ($1,200) / Professional Package ($2,500)

**Access:** https://www.coresentia.com.au/admin

### 7. **Documentation Organization** ✅
- Clarified two-phase approach in README
- Updated PROJECT_PLAN with phase separation
- Clear distinction between:
  - **Phase 1:** CoreSentia Marketing System (OUR leads)
  - **Phase 2:** Client SMS Product Template (THEIR customers)

## 🎨 Brand & UX Refinements

### Action Tag Visibility Fix
**Problem:** Users could see "ACTION: HUMAN_HANDOFF" in messages
**Solution:** Added stripActionTags() to clean all responses
**Result:** Professional, polished UX

### Smart Information Capture
**Problem:** AI asking for email when we already have phone
**Solution:** Updated prompt logic - check what we have first
**Result:** Less friction, better conversion

### Conversation Memory
**Problem:** AI might ask for info already provided
**Solution:** Prompt instructs to check conversation history
**Result:** More natural, human-like interaction

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Decisions

### 1. Two-Phase Approach (Critical Decision)
**Decision:** Build our own marketing system (Phase 1) before client product (Phase 2)

**Rationale:**
- Need working demo for sales ("Text us to try it!")
- Validates product before complex multi-tenant build
- Generates revenue while building Phase 2
- Real customer feedback informs Phase 2 features

**Result:** Phase 1 complete, ready for client acquisition

### 2. Manual Quote Generation (Smart Pragmatism)
**Decision:** Admin generates quotes in Xero manually vs automated

**Rationale:**
- Early stage: Personal touch > automation
- More control over pricing/customization
- Xero integration already exists
- Can automate later with proven process

**Result:** Faster to market, better early customer experience

### 3. SMS Notifications > Email (User Preference)
**Decision:** SMS notifications for admin, email deferred

**Rationale:**
- Immediate attention to hot leads
- Always have phone, not always checking email
- SMS harder to ignore
- Can add email later if needed

**Result:** Faster response time to leads

### 4. Don't Ask for Info We Have (UX Insight)
**Decision:** Check conversation history before requesting info

**Rationale:**
- SMS = already have phone
- Email mentioned earlier = use it
- Asking twice = friction = drop-off
- Speed > complete data collection

**Result:** Better conversion, smoother UX

### 5. Admin Dashboard Priority (Operational Necessity)
**Decision:** Build admin dashboard before Phase 2

**Rationale:**
- Can't manage leads via Supabase SQL
- Need visibility into pipeline
- Essential for daily operations
- Required before acquiring customers

**Result:** Full lead management capability

## 🚀 What's Next: Phase 2 Discussion

### Phase 2: Client SMS Product Template

**Goal:** Build the actual product we sell to customers

**What We Need to Build:**
1. **Multi-business architecture**
   - Separate business profiles
   - Per-business phone numbers
   - Per-business AI customization

2. **Client onboarding system**
   - Business setup wizard
   - Custom AI prompt per business
   - Branding customization (for Professional Package)

3. **Website template builder**
   - One-page template system
   - Color/logo swapping
   - Domain connection guide

4. **Client dashboard**
   - White-label booking dashboard
   - Their customers, not our leads
   - Simplified view (no AI management)

5. **SMS confirmations for bookings**
   - Send to client (tradie)
   - Send to customer
   - Booking reminders

**Key Differences from Phase 1:**
- Phase 1 = Bookings + Quotes (for us)
- Phase 2 = Bookings only (for clients)
- Phase 1 = One business (CoreSentia)
- Phase 2 = Multiple businesses (scalable)

---

## 💭 Strategic Questions for Discussion

### Before Starting Phase 2:

1. **Customer Acquisition First?**
   - Do we want to sell Phase 1 system to a pilot customer?
   - Test with real use case before building Phase 2?
   - Or build Phase 2 now while fresh?

2. **Pilot Program?**
   - Free 3-month hosting for first 3 customers?
   - Get feedback before scaling?
   - Use their needs to inform Phase 2 build?

3. **Phase 2 Scope?**
   - Start with SMS Responder only (simpler)?
   - Or build both tiers (SMS + Website)?
   - How much customization do we offer?

4. **Technical Architecture?**
   - Shared database with business_id?
   - Separate deployments per client?
   - White-label domain approach?

5. **Admin Tools?**
   - Do WE need to see client's conversations?
   - Or purely self-service for clients?
   - What level of support do we provide?
