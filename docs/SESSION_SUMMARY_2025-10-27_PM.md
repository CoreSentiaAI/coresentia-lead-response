## üîß Major Accomplishments

### 1. Fixed AI Bot Legacy Behavior

**Problem:**
- Bot was saying "I'll send you a quote right now" (legacy Ivy behavior)
- Only asking for email, not capturing business context
- Acting like it auto-sends quotes instead of connecting with team
- Not enough qualification data for follow-up

**Solution:**
‚úÖ Updated AI prompt in `/app/api/chat/route.ts`:
- Removed all "I'll send quote automatically" language
- Changed to "Team will send quote within 24 hours"
- Added proper Front Gate positioning
- Instructed AI to capture: Name, Email, Phone, **Industry**, **Main Challenge**

‚úÖ Enhanced lead capture forms (`/app/components/InlineChatForm.tsx`):
- Added **"Industry/Service Type"** field (required)
- Added **"What brings you here?"** field (challenge/need)
- Form now provides actionable context for follow-up

‚úÖ Improved notifications (`/lib/notifications.ts`):
- SMS notifications now include Industry and Challenge
- Added new `meeting_request` notification type
- Full lead context in every alert

**Result:** You now get complete lead profiles: "John Smith, Landscaping, can't answer phone while working"

### 2. Built Complete Pipeline Documentation

**Created `/docs/PIPELINE_WORKFLOW.md`** - Your operations manual:

#### Stage 1: Lead Arrives (Automated)

- Lead created in database

#### Stage 2: Lead Qualification (Automated)
- AI captures: Name, Email, Phone, Industry, Challenge
- Via conversation OR quick action buttons

#### Stage 3: Action Triggered (Automated)
- Quote Request, Meeting Request, or Human Handoff

#### Stage 4: Your Follow-Up (Manual)
- Review in admin dashboard: https://www.coresentia.com.au/admin

- Timeline expectations documented

#### Stage 5: Deal Closed ‚Üí Onboarding (Manual)
**50/50 Deposit Model** (Recommended):

## üí° Key Insights

### Front Gate Model is Clear
- AI captures and qualifies leads ‚úì
- Human (you) closes deals ‚úì
- No auto-quote generation ‚úì
- Personal follow-up = higher conversion ‚úì

### 50/50 Payment Works Best
- Protects both parties
- Industry standard
- Lower barrier than 100% upfront
- Shows commitment

### Form Strategy Decision Needed
**Option A:** Full comprehensive form (20+ fields)
- Captures everything upfront
- No follow-up needed
- Can be overwhelming for clients

**Option B:** Trimmed essential form + setup call (Recommended)
- Form: Core fields only (10 essential fields)
- Call: Gather remaining details personally (15-30 mins)
- More personal, catch issues early, build relationship

**Your preference:** Start with Option B (trimmed form) ‚Üí Expand later if needed
