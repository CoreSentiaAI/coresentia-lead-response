**Author:** Founder + Claude Code
**Purpose:** Market positioning and go-to-market strategy

## 🎯 The Core Problem We Solve

**"You're on the tools, can't answer your phone. Leads text your competitors instead. By the time you reply at 8pm, they've already booked someone else."**

### Target Pain Points

**For Tradies:**
- Miss 3-5 potential jobs per week
- Lose $1,000+ weekly in missed bookings
- Spend evenings returning calls when exhausted
- Look unprofessional with slow responses
- Can't scale beyond solo operation

**For Salons/Services:**
- Phone rings during appointments
- Miss walk-in inquiries
- Double-book accidentally
- Waste time on phone tag
- Lose customers to 24/7 competitors

## 🏆 Our Unique Positioning

### What We Are
**"AI Receptionist for Local Service Businesses"**

We're not:
- ❌ A chatbot platform (generic)
- ❌ A CRM system (too complex)
- ❌ A website builder (Squarespace exists)
- ❌ An AI consultant (too expensive)

We're:
- ✅ A dedicated business number that responds via SMS 24/7
- ✅ An automatic booking system that works while you work
- ✅ A professional web presence (Tier 2)
- ✅ A simple solution to a specific problem

### Differentiation

| Feature | CoreSentia | Competitors |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **SMS-first** | ✅ Dedicated number | ❌ Web chat only |
| **Appointment focus** | ✅ Built for bookings | ⚠️ Generic chat |
| **Target market** | ✅ Trades/local services | ⚠️ Generic SMB |
| **Delivery speed** | ✅ 2-7 days | ❌ 2-8 weeks |
| **Price point** | ✅ $1,200-2,500 | ❌ $3k-10k+ |
| **No website needed** | ✅ SMS works solo | ❌ Website required |

**Key Insight:** Everyone offers web chatbots. No one offers SMS-first booking automation for tradies.

## 💰 Pricing Strategy

### Why $1,200 vs $3,000?

**Psychology:**
- Under $1,500 = impulse buy for small business
- Over $2,000 = requires planning/approval
- $1,200 feels like "tool" not "investment"

**Competition:**
- Drift: $30k/year = 25x our price
- Intercom: $5-10k/year = 8-16x our price
- Tidio: $480/year (but no SMS, no booking) = 2.5x our monthly

**Value Calculation:**
- Tradie loses 3 jobs/week × $100/job = $300/week
- $1,200 setup + 4 weeks × $150 = $1,800 total
- Break-even: 6 jobs (2 weeks)
- Month 2+: Pure profit

### Pricing Psychology

**SMS Responder: $1,200**
- Feels: "I can afford this today"
- Compares to: One big job, a decent tool
- ROI: 2 weeks = easy yes
- Objection: "Too cheap?" = "Is it real?"

**Professional Package: $2,500**
- Feels: "Investment in my business"
- Compares to: Budget website + booking system
- ROI: 3-4 weeks = still fast
- Objection: "Do I need the website?" = upsell

### Pilot Strategy

**Free 3-month hosting** (save $450-750)
- Only pay setup fee
- Hosting free months 1-3
- In exchange: testimonial + referrals
- Lock-in: 6-month minimum after pilot

**Why it works:**
- Lower barrier ($1,200 vs $2,400 year 1)
- Builds trust (skin in the game)
- Ensures engagement (they use it)
- Creates advocates (referrals)

## ✅ Strategic Principles

### What We Believe

1. **Focus > Feature:** One thing done well beats ten things done poorly
2. **Speed > Perfect:** Ship fast, learn, iterate
3. **Simple > Clever:** Boring technology, remarkable results
4. **Customers > Competitors:** Build what they need, not what sounds cool
5. **ROI > Buzz:** "Made me $10k" beats "uses GPT-4"

### What We Don't Do

- ❌ Build features no one asked for
- ❌ Compete on "most AI" or "most features"
- ❌ Try to serve everyone
- ❌ Sacrifice simplicity for sophistication
- ❌ Chase trends over customer needs

### Decision Framework

When unsure, ask:
1. **Does this help a tradie book more jobs?**
2. **Can we deliver it in < 1 week?**
3. **Is it worth the complexity?**
4. **Would we pay for this?**

If "no" to any → don't build it.

**Remember:** The best strategy is the one that gets you to 10 paying customers. Everything else is theory. Go talk to tradies. Build what they need. Ship it fast. Learn. Iterate.
